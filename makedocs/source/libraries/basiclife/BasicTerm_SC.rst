.. module:: basiclife.BasicTerm_SC

The **BasicTerm_SC** Model
==========================

Overview
--------

The :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC` model is a variant of :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_S` that
is optimized for generating a compiled model using
`Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ with `modelx-cython <https://github.com/fumitoh/modelx-cython>`_.

Like the original model, :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC` can be exported as a pure Python model
(also called a "nomx" model), which is written as standard Python objects and does not depend on modelx.
This exported model can then be compiled with Cython using the modelx-cython package
(see `the relevant blog post <https://modelx.io/blog/2023/10/21/introducing-modelx-cython/>`_
for more details on modelx-cython).

A compiled version of :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC` runs about 7â€“8 times faster
than its nomx model but yields the same results as :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_S`.
With future improvements to modelx-cython, it is expected that the compiled model
will run even faster. Although :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_S` can also be compiled
by modelx-cython, it achieves only about twice the speed of its nomx model,
because it was not written to take full advantage of Cython optimizations.

The :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC` model thus serves as an example of
how to optimize a modelx model for generating a fast compiled version.


Optimization Strategy
---------------------

:mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC` is derived from :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_S` by applying the following changes
to make its cythonized model run faster:

* **Use of primitive types**
  To accelerate cash flow projection over a large number of model points,
  high-level Python objects (such as strings, lists, dictionaries, and pandas DataFrames)
  are removed from the :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection` space.
  Formulas in that space are instead written to operate primarily on primitive numeric types,
  such as ``int`` and ``float``.

* **Separate data and projection**
  Cells for reading input data from files have been moved to the :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data` space.
  Input data (such as policy attributes) is held in NumPy arrays instead of pandas DataFrames.

* **Parameterize with array indices**
  The :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection` space is parameterized by an array index,
  :attr:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection.idx`
  (rather than ``point_id``) to identify model points.
  :attr:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection.idx` is used as a key
  to look up the value of the selected model point in the arrays of policy attributes.


Basic Usage
-----------

This section explains the steps to create the cythonized version of the *BasicTerm_SC* model.

Install C compiler, Cython, and modelx-cython
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to lifelib and modelx, you need to install Cython and modelx-cython.
Because Cython requires a C compiler, install one if necessary by following the
instructions in Cython's official documentation.

Then install Cython and modelx-cython using pip::

    > pip install Cython

    > pip install modelx-cython

Or using conda, if you're using Anaconda::

    > conda install Cython

    > conda install modelx-cython


Copy the basiclife library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create your own copy of the *basiclife* library by following
the steps in the :doc:`/quickstart/index` page.
Within the copied folder, you will find a *BasicTerm_SC* subfolder that contains the model.

Because *BasicTerm_SC* is a modelx model, you can load and run it
from IPython or Spyder (with the spyder-modelx plugin).

For example, in IPython with your current directory set to the location of *BasicTerm_SC*::

    >>> import modelx as mx

    >>> model = mx.read_model("BasicTerm_SC")

If you're using Spyder, open the *MxExplorer* pane, right-click on an empty area,
choose *Read Model*, then select the *BasicTerm_SC* folder.


Export and compile the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, export the modelx model to create a pure-Python (nomx) model.
Use the ``export`` method on the model object as follows (IPython example)::

    >>> model.export("BasicTerm_SC_nomx")

This command exports the model as a Python package named "BasicTerm_SC_nomx" in the current directory.

You can test the exported (nomx) model by importing it and accessing its cells. For instance::

    >>> from BasicTerm_SC_nomx import mx_model

    >>> mx_model.Projection[0].result_pv()

    >>> mx_model.Projection[9999].result_pv()

(Here, ``mx_model`` is the nomx model object.)


Cythonize the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The modelx-cython package provides a shell command named ``mx2cy``.
To generate a compiled version of :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC`, change to the
directory containing the exported nomx model (e.g., the folder with *BasicTerm_SC_nomx*)
and run::

    > mx2cy BasicTerm_SC

To see help options, run::

    > mx2cy --help

    usage: mx2cy [-h] [--sample SAMPLE] [--spec SPEC] [--setup SETUP] [--translate-only | --compile-only] model_path

    Translate an exported modelx model into Cython and compile it.

    positional arguments:
      model_path        Path to an exported modelx model to translate into Cython

    options:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --sample SAMPLE   Path to a sample file to run for collecting type information (default: sample.py)
      --spec SPEC       Path to a spec file for setting parameters (default: spec.py)
      --setup SETUP     Path to a setup file for Cython (default: setup.py)
      --translate-only  Perform translation only (default: False)
      --compile-only    Perform compilation only (default: False)

The ``mx2cy`` command requires two files, ``sample.py`` and ``spec.py``, both included in
the *basiclife* library. When run, ``mx2cy`` does the following:

1. Executes ``sample.py`` to collect run-time type information for ``BasicTerm_SC_nomx``.
2. Outputs a folder *BasicTerm_SC_nomx_cy*, containing Cython-translated files.
3. Compiles the translated files into a binary module using Cython, producing the compiled model
   in *BasicTerm_SC_nomx_cy*.


Test the compiled model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``run_sc.py`` script to test speed and memory usage. For the compiled (Cython) model::

    > python run_sc.py --cython
    {'value': 1448.9630534601538, 'mem_use': 477.5078125, 'time': 1.5274626000027638}

For comparison, run the nomx version::

    > python run_sc.py --nomx
    {'value': 1448.9630534601563, 'mem_use': 2050.42578125, 'time': 11.355696699989494}

The script calculates the present value of net cash flows for 10,000 model points
and outputs the total present value, the maximum memory usage, and the time taken.


Model Specifications
--------------------

:mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC` consists of two spaces: :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data`
and :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection`.

- The :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data` space contains references to input files and cells
  for loading input data. In :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_S`, these tasks were done in the Projection space.
  In *BasicTerm_SC*, the model point table is kept as a pandas DataFrame in
  :attr:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data.model_point_table`, and each attribute (e.g., `policy_term`)
  is stored in a NumPy array. The NumPy array index is used for identifying model points.

- The :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection` space contains the projection logic for a
  single model point, parameterized by an array index
  :attr:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection.idx` (instead of ``point_id``).
  Formulas here reference the NumPy arrays in :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data`.


The Data Space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data

Model point data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model point data is stored in an Excel file named *model_point_table.xlsx*
under the library directory.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~age_at_entry
   ~sex
   ~policy_term
   ~policy_count
   ~point_id
   ~sum_assured

Assumption data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mortality table is stored in *mort_table.xlsx* under the model folder and read
into :attr:`mort_table` as a DataFrame. :func:`mort_table_array` converts this DataFrame
into a NumPy array, adding rows filled with ``nan`` to align row indices with ages.
:func:`mort_table_array` is then used by
:func:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection.mort_rate` in the Projection space.

The discount rate data is stored in *disc_rate_ann.xlsx* under the model folder
and read into :attr:`disc_rate_ann` as a Series, which is then converted into a NumPy array.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~mort_table_array
   ~disc_rate_ann_array


The Projection Space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Projection

Projection parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This model represents new business, with all model points issued at time 0. The
time step is monthly. Cash flows and other time-dependent variables are indexed by ``t``.

Flows that accumulate throughout period ``t`` (until ``t+1``) have indices ``t``,
while balance items indexed by ``t`` represent the value at that exact time.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~proj_len
   ~duration

Model point data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same *model_point_table.xlsx* file under the model folder is referenced to obtain
model point data such as ages, sum assured, and terms.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~age
   ~age_at_entry
   ~sex
   ~sum_assured
   ~policy_term

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

:func:`mort_rate` reads annual mortality rates from
:func:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data.mort_table_array`
in :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data` and converts them to monthly rates via
:func:`mort_rate_mth`.

:func:`disc_rate_mth` reads annual discount rates from
:func:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data.disc_rate_ann_array` in :mod:`~basiclife.BasicTerm_SC.Data`
and converts them to monthly discount factors via :func:`disc_factor`.

:func:`lapse_rate` is defined as a simple function of policy duration.
:func:`expense_acq` is the acquisition expense per policy at ``t=0``,
and :func:`expense_maint` is the annual maintenance expense per policy,
inflated at a constant rate (:func:`inflation_rate`).

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~mort_rate
   ~mort_rate_mth
   ~disc_factor
   ~disc_rate_mth
   ~lapse_rate
   ~expense_acq
   ~expense_maint
   ~inflation_factor
   ~inflation_rate

Policy values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the death benefit for each policy (:func:`claim_pp`) equals :attr:`sum_assured`.
All model points pay monthly premiums for the entire policy term.

The monthly premium per policy (:func:`premium_pp`) is calculated as
``(1 + loading_prem) * net_premium_pp``,
where the net premium is set so that the present value of net premiums equals
the present value of claims. This product has no surrender value.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~claim_pp
   ~net_premium_pp
   ~loading_prem
   ~premium_pp

Policy decrement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initially, each model point is assumed to have one policy in force. The in-force
policies decrease by lapses and deaths each month, and any remaining policies at
the end of the policy term reach maturity and exit.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~pols_death
   ~pols_if
   ~pols_if_init
   ~pols_lapse
   ~pols_maturity

Cashflows
~~~~~~~~~

Cashflows consist of acquisition expenses at ``t=0``, maintenance expenses thereafter,
commissions, premiums, and claims. Commissions are assumed to be 100% of premium during
the first policy year and zero afterward.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~claims
   ~commissions
   ~premiums
   ~expenses
   ~net_cf

Present values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cells whose names begin with ``pv_`` compute present values of various flows.
Although :func:`pols_if` is not itself a cashflow, it is used as an annuity factor
in :func:`net_premium_pp`.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../generated/
   :template: mxbase.rst

   ~pv_claims
   ~pv_commissions
   ~pv_expenses
   ~pv_net_cf
   ~pv_pols_if
   ~pv_premiums
   ~check_pv_net_cf

Results

:func:`result_cf` returns a DataFrame of monthly cashflows and decrements for a
selected model point::

:func:`result_pv` returns the present values of these cashflows,
along with each flowâ€™s percentage relative to the present value of premiums::
