New Library
===============

This release adds a new library :mod:`~economic_curves`.
The :mod:`~economic_curves` library includes Python scripts and notebooks
that contain practical algorithms for modeling economic scenarios,
many of which are relevant to regulatory requirements
in UK and EU countries under the Solvency 2 regime.

This library was based on
`insurance_python <https://github.com/open-source-modelling/insurance_python>`_, a library in an external project,
the `Actuarial Algorithms <https://github.com/open-source-modelling>`_,
developed and maintained by Qnity Consultants and Gregor Fabjan.

See :mod:`~economic_curves` and :ref:`notebooks_economic_curves` for more details.
