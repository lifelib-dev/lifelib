    "\n",
    "This noteook demonstrates the usage of [ifrs17sim] project in [lifelib], by building and running a model and drawing waterfall graphs that depict how balancesheet items change and cashflows emerge over one or multiple periods using cashflows of a single modelpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those charts are:\n",
    "* Present value of expected cashflows\n",
    "* CSM amortization\n",
    "* Actual cashflows\n",
    "* IFRS17 Financial performance\n",
    "\n",

    "The primary purpose of this model is to showcase the capability of [lifelib] and its base system [modelx], and less attention has been paid to the accuracy of the model or the compliance with the accounting standards. \n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>The timing of cashflows is either the beginning or end of each step.</li>\n",
    "  <li>All expenses are included in insurance cashflows.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Loss component logic is not yet incorporated, so `CSM` can be negative.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Coverage unit is set to sum assured</li>\n",
    "  <li>The amortization schedule of acquisition cashflows is constant over time.</li>\n",
