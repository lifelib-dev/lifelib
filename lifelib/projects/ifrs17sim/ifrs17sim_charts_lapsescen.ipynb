    "\n",
    "This notebook draws several waterfall charts that show how sources of change in IFRS17 accounts emerge when the actual lapse rate changes at a future point in time and future lapse rate assumptions from that point change accordingly for current-estimate liability valuations at future points. \n",
    "\n",

    "* Actual cashflows\n",
    "* Present value of expected cashflows\n",
    "* CSM amortization\n",
    "* IFRS17 Financial performance\n",
