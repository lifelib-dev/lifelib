    "# 3. Memory-Optimized Mutiprocess Example \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to effectively run a heavy model with a large data set.\n",
    "The demonstration utilizes techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiprocessing using [ipyparallel]\n",
    "* Memory-optimized runs introduced in [modelx v0.19.0](https://docs.modelx.io/en/latest/releases/relnotes_v0_19_0.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiprocessing by ipyparallel**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a technique to make use of multiple CPU cores on a machine or on multiple machines\n",
    "by splitting a task into multiple processes.\n",
    "The multiple processes run in parallel on the multiple CPU cores, reducing the total run time required to finish the task.\n",
    "The [ipyparallel] package makes it easy and simple to perform multiprocessing.\n",
    "[ipyparallel] provides the following functions that are required for multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling both synchronous and asynchronous communications.\n",
    "* Sending and receiving numpy and pandas objects fast to and from engines.\n",
    "* Communicating with remote machines in the same way as with the localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory-optimized run**\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory-optimized run is a feature that is introduced in modelx v0.19. \n",
    "Running a heaviy model with a large data set consumes a lot of memory. \n",
    "This feature makes it possible to run the model using less memory.\n",
    "For this feature, you need 2 runs. The first run is to get a list of *actions* and\n",
    "the model should be run with a small set of data.\n",
    "The second run is performed with the entire data set for getting the desired output.\n",
    "For more about memory-optimized run, see [modelx documentation](https://docs.modelx.io/en/latest/reference/generated/modelx.core.model.Model.execute_actions.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps in this notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "The demonstration in this notebook involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A table of 100,000 model points is loaded.\n",
    "* A sample model is loaded in this Python process.\n",
    "* The model is run to generate *actions*. The actions are saved within the model.\n",
    "* 10 IPython engines are invoked, and a block of 10,000 model points is sent to each engine.\n",
    "* Each engine loads and runs the saved model with the 10,000 model by executing the actions saved in the model.\n",
    "* This process receives the results from all the engines and concatinate them.\n",

    "To run this notebook, the following packages are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [modelx] 0.19.1 or newer is required to run this notebook.\n",
    "* [ipyparallel] 8.2.0 or newer is required to run this notebook.\n",
    "* `numpy`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`\n",
    "\n",
    "If either of the packages above is missing or outdated, install them using either `pip` or `conda` command depending on your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of March 12, 2022, ipyparallel 8.2.0 is available on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ipyparallel/), but not in [the anaconda package](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/py3.9_win-64/).\n",
    "So if you're using anaconda, update ipyparallel by `conda install -c conda-forge ipyparallel=8.2.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook consumes 8 to 9 GB memory, so make sure your machine has enough memory space available for the run.\n",

    "This notebook uses the `CashValue_ME` model in the `savings` library with 100 model points generated by a notebook \n",

    "Run th notebook and a model point file named `model_point_table_100K.xlsx` is created.\n",

    "This example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* launches 10 IPython engines,\n",
    "* loads 100,000 model points,\n",
    "* Send a block of 10,000 model points to each engine,\n",
    "* runs modelx with the 10,000 model points on each engine and\n",
